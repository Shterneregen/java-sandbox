// As System.out.println needs to be executed on executing the Test class, this means special main method should replace /*INSERT*/.
// Special main method's name should be "main" (all characters in lower case), should be static,
// should have public access specifier and it accepts argument of String [] type.
// String [] argument can use any identifier name, even though in most of the cases you will see "args" is used.
// Position of static and public can be changed but return type must come just before the method name.
